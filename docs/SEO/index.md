SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.

## How does SEO work?]

Search engines such as Google and Bing use bots to crawl pages on the web, going from site to site, collecting information about those pages and putting them in an index. Think of the index like a giant library where a librarian can pull up a book (or a web page) to help you find exactly what you’re looking for at the time.

Next, algorithms analyze pages in the index, taking into account hundreds of ranking factors or signals, to determine the order pages should appear in the search results for a given query. In our library analogy, the librarian has read every single book in the library and can tell you exactly which one will have the answers to your questions.

## SEO vs React vs Next

SEO is crucial for anyone with a website who wants it to be discovered through Google search, and Next.js helps immensely with exactly that. SPAs are great because they are fast, flexible and adaptable. But a major SPA downside is, because they are mostly client-side rendered, when Google’s crawler looks for data, they can’t find any until they are rendered on the server side, too.
