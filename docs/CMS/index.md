# CMS

A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS, is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

## HeadLess CMS

Headless Content Management Systems start the same. You can author, edit, and store content and data within the system, but the departure from a traditional CMS is in the templating. Instead of using the CMS templating system to create the page, all of that is offloaded onto a separate framework outside the CMS. This is accomplished through an Application Programming Interface (API), which allows content within the system to be accessible as data. That's a simplified version of the API concept, but all you really need to know is that rendering your web page is external to the CMS.

## Strapi
