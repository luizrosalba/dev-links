Currying in JavaScript is a process that allows you to transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions.

In other words, instead of a function taking all arguments at one time, it takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one and returns a new function, which takes the third one, and so on, until all arguments have been fulfilled.

```jsx title='Example'
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}
sum(1, 2, 3); // 6
```

As you can see, this is a function with full arguments. Letâ€™s create a curried version of the function and see how we would call the same function (and get the same result) in a series of calls:

```jsx title='currying example'
function sum(a) {
  return (b) => {
    return (c) => {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)); // 6
```

We could even separate this sum(1)(2)(3) to understand it better:

```jsx title='Separating'
const sum1 = sum(1);
const sum2 = sum1(2);
const result = sum2(3);
console.log(result); // 6
```
