Currying in JavaScript is a process that allows you to transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nesting functions.

In other words, instead of a function taking all arguments at one time, it takes the first one and returns a new function, which takes the second one and returns a new function, which takes the third one, and so on, until all arguments have been fulfilled.
