Found this article with some good examples about react [performance](https://webtips.dev/webtips/react-hooks/usecallback?_branch_match_id=1119042556059019777&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz8nMy9bLTU3JLM3VS87P1U%2F3yzItMHYLN3NMAgCpG4g8IwAAAA%3D%3D). Got motivated and started a repo with the example to study this useCallback and useMemo concepts.
